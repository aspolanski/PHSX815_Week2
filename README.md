# PHSX815_Week2

# Notes for Homework 3

* Adapted *Random.py* and added the method *Poisson* which takes a lambda value as input and outputs a sample from that distribution

* Added new script (*sample_plot.py*) that uses *Random.py* to sample the Poisson distribution and produce a plot.

# Notes for Homework 4

* Used the *CookieTimer.py* script to generate samples of a distribution and outputted them as *cookie_times.txt* 

* Finished *CookieAnalysis.py* to take the cookie times file and produce two plots: *times_hist.pdf* and *times_avg_hist.pdf*
